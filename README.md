# Self-Playing Piano

This repository contains the complete control system for the self-playing piano:

- `apps/web`: public song library, password-protected piano controls and authenticated administration.
- `packages/midi`: deterministic MIDI-to-piano artifact processing.
- `packages/database`: Neon/Postgres schema, migration and bootstrap utilities.
- `packages/infrastructure`: interchangeable Vercel Blob/S3 and MQTT adapters.
- `firmware/esp32`: Wi-Fi/BLE provisioning, MQTT, artifact playback and SPI scheduling.
- `firmware/nano`: safe event queue and six-board PCA9685 solenoid control.
- `tools/device-simulator`: MQTT/HTTP simulator for development without the piano.

The original MIDI remains in object storage. Postgres stores metadata and state; the ESP32 downloads one compact immutable `.spp` artifact into RAM when Play is requested.

## Local checks

Install Node.js 22+ and pnpm, then run:


```sh
pnpm install
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

PlatformIO firmware builds (the ESP32 target requires the ignored `device_config.h` described below):

```sh
pio test --project-dir firmware/shared --environment native
pio test --project-dir firmware/embedded-tests --environment native
pio run --project-dir firmware/nano
pio run --project-dir firmware/esp32
```

Both boards derive their release identity from
`firmware/shared/include/spp_release.h`. Keep that version identical and flash
the two generated images together.

The embedded test harness runs the production artifact parser, ESP32 playback
scheduler, SPI protocol client, Nano queue/watchdog and solenoid policy together
with deterministic time and fault injection. See
[docs/embedded-testing.md](docs/embedded-testing.md) for its guarantees and the
small set of checks that still require physical hardware.

## Cloud setup

1. Create Neon, a Vercel Blob store and an EMQX deployment.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `apps/web/.env.local` and fill every active value. The database and simulator commands load this same file for local development; Vercel uses its configured project environment instead.
3. Generate two password hashes, one for administration and one shared by people allowed to control the piano:

   ```sh
   pnpm --filter @spp/web auth:hash -- "your-password"
   ```

   The command returns a base64 value. Put the respective outputs in `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH_BASE64` and `CONTROLLER_PASSWORD_HASH_BASE64`. The shared password never leaves the web application and is unrelated to MQTT credentials.

4. Apply the schema and create/update the initial profile and piano:

   ```sh
   pnpm db:migrate
   pnpm db:bootstrap
   ```

   Bootstrap prints the piano UUID. Use that exact UUID in Vercel, EMQX and ESP32 configuration. `PIANO_DEVICE_TOKEN` must also be identical during bootstrap and firmware configuration.

5. Import this repository into Vercel with the repository root as the project root. Add the production variables from `.env.example`; `vercel.json` builds the pnpm workspace and serves `apps/web`.
6. Configure the EMQX identities and authorization rules in [docs/emqx.md](docs/emqx.md), then apply the Vercel protections in [docs/vercel-security.md](docs/vercel-security.md).
7. Generate the ignored ESP32 configuration from the local environment. The command validates the live EMQX, Vercel and Blob TLS chains and includes only their trusted roots:

   ```sh
   pnpm device:configure
   ```

   Builds intentionally fail without this ignored device configuration. Set `PIANO_PROVISION_POP` before running the command to override the default BLE proof-of-possession value `piano-setup`.
8. With solenoid power disabled, flash both devices. The SPI protocol is intentionally incompatible with the old firmware, so do not update only one board.
9. Power the ESP32 and provision Wi-Fi with Espressif's provisioning app. Use the BLE device named `PROV_PIANO_…` and the proof-of-possession value configured by `kProvisionPop`.
10. Sign in at `/admin` and batch-upload the MIDI files from `firmware/esp32/midi_files` if they should form the initial library.

## Important hardware defaults

- Playback accepts MIDI 21–108 and caps polyphony at 10.
- Repeated activation of one key keeps a 100 ms release gap.
- Processed songs include a five-second visual lead-in.
- Artifact v2 keeps the musical strike time separate from a 20 ms solenoid activation lead; the falling-note display always follows musical timing.
- Velocity is preserved but v1 intentionally drives every active solenoid at PWM 4095.
- The `legacy-v1` map preserves the current wiring: logical keys 0–72 use outputs 8–80, keys 73–86 use 82–95, and key 87 is explicitly unmapped.
- Every stop, error, watchdog timeout and boot clears all 96 PCA outputs.

The runtime intentionally has only two owners: a playback task owns state/SPI and a network task owns Wi-Fi/BLE/MQTT/HTTP. Blocking Internet work therefore cannot interrupt Nano supervision. See [docs/reliability.md](docs/reliability.md).

Investigating the shifted high-note wiring only requires updating the 88-entry map, incrementing the profile/firmware version and reprocessing songs. The external artifact, MQTT and SPI shapes already carry logical keys and velocity.

## Device simulator

With the web app and EMQX configured, populate the simulator variables from `.env.example` and run:

```sh
pnpm --filter @spp/device-simulator dev
```

It uses the same desired/reported topics, artifact endpoint and durable status endpoint as the ESP32.
